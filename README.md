# Competitive Programming Growth Journey

## Introduction
This repository is there to document my progress put into Competitive Programming, display my effort to build credibility and contribute within the community and serve as a transparent record of my journey and experiences with the community.

## Goals
1 - Improve my skill and understanding across many platforms and sticking to a clean and readable format.
2 - Demonstrate ethical growth by following all rules and formalities on all platforms used.
3 - Write editorials or detailed solutions or answers that can help others learn or avoid common mistakes.

## My Personal Commitments
### Routine:
Start with 10 to 15 problems a week on various platform problemsets on basic topics transitioning to 20 to 30 harder problems as my speed, knowledge and learning progress.
Track solved problems in the format below and regularly commit to this repo to highlight resilience and personal advancement.
Also, create short editorials to solidify my own understanding of the problems and topics but also to slowly start helping other people at a similar skill level to me.

### Public Engagement:
Participate in public contests whenever possible (some constraints exist due to time zones and personal life).
Write longer tutorials or blog posts for complex questions to showcase different approaches and their corresponding results on the same problem.
Share my own views or technique to solving types of problems both directly to do with competitive programming but also about computer science more generally.

### Long-Term Efforts
Contribute to open source projects or open problems and delve deeper into topics.
Hopefully be allowed and able to write interesting problems and editorials for live contests for others to learn from.
Compete in more British and maybe international Olympiads and conduct academic research in CS.

## Code Format
Platform: Depends on problem source
Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme
Date Solved: DD/MM/YYYY
Language Used: Most often will be c++.
Concepts Learned: Topic tags like greedy or combinatorics.
Approach Overview: Kind of like a short editorial but less formal.

# Checkpoints
Will be updated as I solve more problems and get better.
